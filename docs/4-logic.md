## 4.1 Whats in here.
    This the part where it starts making sense.
    I will write here what each part should do. OPEN TO ADDITIONS. Whats nesseary is nesseary
    This will actually say what happens in a REAL FUSION REACTOR. You've been warned

## 4.2 -  Startup.
    PREAMBLE - BEFORE START
        Open DEUTERIUM valve
        FLOOD THE VAPOR CHAMBER with water. [ Valve 2]
        Wait for the chamber to flood. 
        CLOSE BOTH VALVES.
        ENABLE TURBINES
        CLOSE THE TURBINE INTAKE VALVE
    Startup is complex.
        A valve is opened. This floods the reactor chamber in a gas. [GAS NAME IS DEUTERIUM]
        Once valve is closed. The ingnition begins. This will initiate a small lithium cannon. Firing lithium atoms at the given object. Afterwards reactor ignites.
    After Ignition
        before doing anything. GET THE PLASMA RING TO ABOUT 30%. DONT OVERDO IT
        You will need to activate in 60 seconds 3 things. 
            ONE is the ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT. [AKA COPPER CAGE]
            TWO is the cooling of the "COPPER CAGE"
            THREE is the turbines. you will need to start them up. of not already started up.
    If the temperature is good. you will gain pressure on the vapor chamber. Opening the turbine intake valve 
    will allow it to go to turbines which produces energy. [for every MW/S you gain 10 MONEY]
    
## The temperature system. 
    There will be multiple factors. Which all go to a final number. HEAT GAIN
        COOLANT
        REACTOR FUEL INTEGRITY
        PLASMA RING.
        'COPPER CAGE' ELECRITY ammount
        PRESSURE Inside the reactor
    COOLANT. Coolant is simple
        Depending on temperature the coolant will be more or less effective.
            Factors are
                REFRIGIRATION
                CURRENT TEMP OF COOLANT
                CURRENT FLOW OF COOLANT
            this is a negative number. COOLING MAX=-(15.8*{COOLANT}*{FLOW}^{0.576})
            this is just the negative number.
    
    TEMP Calculations.
        this is basically just a flat number.

lets work for now on the cli ONLY. There are going to be 3 JAVASCRIPT IDs through which we can gather input and write output. 
.command - Input field. User types the command here
.output  - Output - here are command outputs. Like '404 NOT FOUND' or 'SYNTAX ERROR'
.screen  - Screen output. Here will be very simple topdown and side view of the reactor. This will be done using ascii and some other things.
